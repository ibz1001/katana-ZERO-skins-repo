# katana-ZERO-skins-repo
a repository for storing katana zero patch files for recolour/resprite mods

Download whichever skin you want and use DeltaPatcherLite.exe to apply that patch to your game (select "data.win" in your katana zero game files, usually located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Katana ZERO\data.win"). When you launch the game from the launcher of your choice (e.g. Steam) it will launch the file named data.win, this way if you made copies before applying patches then you can just rename the files on the fly you launch the one you want

**always make sure to backup your data.win file before patching, you can also verify file integrity on steam to revert changes to data.win if anything goes wrong**

if you want your reskin to be added to this repo dm me on discord snek pliskin#8677 with all of the sprites:
>if you want to change the pheonix edge fully, you also need to change the flame sprite

>if you want to change the savant knife fully, you need to change all three versions of the slash

>the sword of masters also has a projectile included that should also be changed

all of the base sprites can also be downloaded [here](.sword base sprites)
